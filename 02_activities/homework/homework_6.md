**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my current role as a product manager, I work with sensitive data, including names and birthdays, which means I need to be extra mindful about privacy and ethics. Qadri’s article about databases shaping ideas of family shows how even simple data can have bigger impacts, like excluding certain people. The other article on neural networks also reminds me that the data we use can reflect human biases, even when we don’t mean for it to.

Looking ahead, I’ll focus on using anonymized data whenever possible to help avoid privacy issues or misuse. This is especially important since I work with personal data like names and birthdays. I’ll also push to make sure ethical data practices are considered at every step, from the start of development to the final product. 

It is a good reminder when working with data to think through how we’re collecting and using data, and to make sure we’re not accidentally harming or leaving anyone out.
